spectral analysis F=1024
- grab F samples into real part, multiply by hamming window
- create array of F samples for imaginary part
- run FFT
- ignoring f=0 and f=nyquist, assign power = re^2 + im^2 to each sample in frame. find highest power 
- normalize all samples in all frames to max power across all frames
- store frequencies for each frame

pitch detection L=110 U=880
- autocorrelate
- each window is (samples/L)*2
- starting from (samples/L) through (samples/U) 
for( var comb:int=combLow; comb>=combHigh; comb-- ) {
	var power:Number = 0;
	for( var w:int=0; w<comb; w++ ) {
		power += samps[w] * samps[w+comb];
	}
	
	// Try to compensate for octave errors: Multiply by the comb width
	//power *= comb;	// NO, we're already summing less samples for narrower combs
	
	if( power > bestPower ) {
		bestPower = power;
		bestComb = comb;
	}
}
